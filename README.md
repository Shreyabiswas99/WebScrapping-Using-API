# Automating Crypto Website API 
* Web Scrapping and automating data pull of a popular crypto website named CoinMarket: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/ 
* Taking the API key generated from this website, this website was scrapped where all the details of the latest cryto currencies was scrapped using BeautifulSoup and requests in Python.
* Created an api runner function which when called will start the api running and along with that update it with latest timestamps
* Storing it in a dataframe and using pandas to format and clean the data to better understand the trends across the market
* Lastly using Seaborn and Matplotlib library in Python to create simple visualizations for our data
